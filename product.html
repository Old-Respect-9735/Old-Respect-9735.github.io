                     The Emotion Detector is an Open CV program that tracks a user's facial expressions in real time to determine happiness. The use of such a program makes the user more aware of their emotional state and, when used in conjunction with the rest of Oasis, can help the user make more informed decisions about their mental health. Find out more about the project in the following GitHub repository:

                      Although Oasis is mainly focused on your mental health, physical health is just as important, and low physical health will often negatively influence your mental state. Thus, we desire to improve your physical state in any way we can, such as through our Face Touching Detector. 

Health officials often advocate for people to stop touching their faces, as we are constantly touching contaminated surfaces, and this touching provides the perfect pathway for harmful pathogens to enter our system and give us diseases. However, especially in a computer setting, it can be hard to break this habit. The Face Touching Detector uses data from your camera to detect and display a ringing sound whenever you touch your face, only stopping the sound once you take your hand off. Simply by opening the localhost website, you can continue to work or enjoy leisure time while breaking this harmful habit.

To try the website for your own, follow the directions of the following github repository:

                      <p>The partial autocorrelation function is used to determine how the past and future data points are related in a time series. This can be thought as the correlation between two points that are separated by some number of periods n, but, with the effect of the intervening correlation meaning the comparison of points with more spaced out values. The Partial AutoCorrelation model tends to follow the autocorrelation model meaning that values have some correlation to one another.</p>
                      <p>Here is the autocorrelation model. In Machine Learning, an ARIMA model other known as an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model is used to predict the future of a dataset based on previous data. The purpose of an Auto Correlation model is to tell the users how related the data is with respect to one another. This can be fulfilled by using the AD Fuller Test. An AD-Fuller test utilizes the average of the data along with lag models to find a relationship between the data points.</p>
