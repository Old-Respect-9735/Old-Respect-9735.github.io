The web application is made to assess and provide "relief" for the mental health of the younger generations, which has been shown to be on the decline 
ever since the pandemic. A major factor in our assessment is the DASS 21 questionnaire, which asks questions revolving around depression, stress, and anxiety. 
With a user's answer to this questionnaire, we are given their individual scores in for the different types of questions. With these individual scores, we 
created a new metric called an "Oasis Score", which is a combination of the three scores out of 1000. The Oasis Score is divided up evenely to classify a 
user as sad, neutral, and happy, which changes the media presented to the user. The other tab has a simple game that can relieve stress through satisfying 
gameplay, and the product tab goes over our main products, the emotion detector and the "HandsOff" program.
